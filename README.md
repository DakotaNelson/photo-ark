Joel Sartore has a wonderful series of photos known as the [Photo Ark](http://www.joelsartore.com/galleries/the-photo-ark/). A friend of mine was interested in having all of the photos to use as a series of rotating desktop backgrounds, and wasn't too excited about downloading them one at a time, so I whipped up a script to grab them all. Now I'm pushing it to Github, because why not.

To run, just execute `./run.sh`.
